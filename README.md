# Emotional-Classification-in-Social-Media-Text
Emotion classification project for social-media style text. This repo contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the data and trains multiple NLP models (TF-IDF + SVM, Bi-LSTM, CNN, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa) to predict emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise, with evaluation using accuracy and macro-F1.
